	<h2>Growing up</h2>
	<p>I was born in the winter during the year 2007 to a Dominican/Puerto Rican household that never slept.  Growing up I was always a very shy and introverted child that was pretty much sheltered up until middle school hit.  I never really liked school and was bullied up until the end of elementary also adding to my dislike in it.  Up until 7th grade when covid hit I began to speak more and express myself because of some pages on tiktok informing me how to be more confident not to say I was never confident as a kid but the idea of being confident wasnt really nessacary if I didnt have any insecurities or knew what to be confident about.  It wasnt until 9th grade hit where I completely changed and developed into a new person from being that shy introvet to the loud extrovert that wasnt scared to talk to anyone.     </p>
	
	<h2>Likes</h2>
	<p> I like doing a handful of things such as going on walks wether to get energy out my body or to think.  I love to play online games with my friends while on call.  I love writing, writing is my peace and mind when I am stressed.  It tends to my over creative head.  Fulfilling the thirst to express whats on my mind in a sweet and personal way.
